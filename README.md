# VBA Sync&#x2001;![VBA Sync logo](http://i.imgur.com/sQAsBy4.png)

Microsoft Office VBA code is usually held in binary format, making proper
version control difficult. VBA Sync synchronizes macros between a
VBA-enabled file and a folder, enabling easy version control using Git, SVN,
Mercurial, or any other VCS.

**I no longer maintain this project. I have released it into the public domain.**

[**Download my final release (v2.2.0)**](https://github.com/chelh/VBASync/releases/latest)  
[**Look for a newer version, or advertise your new version**](https://github.com/chelh/VBASync/issues/36)

## Features
VBA Sync works *directly with the Office file,* unlike most
other solutions, which use a host application (e.g., Excel) to manipulate
the VBA code. This gives it several advantages:
  * Does not require special Excel settings.
  * Does not add to your VBA code base.
  * Allows you to use any off-the-shelf version control system.
  * Allows you to cherry-pick which modules to extract or publish.
  * Minimizes spurious changes by ignoring case on variable names,
    making merges easier.
  * Extracts full code including several hidden attributes.
  * Also extracts settings not tied to a particular module,
    like references.
  * Generates FRX files compatible with the VBE, but
    *without* any embedded timestamp.
  * Allows you to extract or publish a FRM module without necessarily
    updating its FRX module.
  * Works with document or worksheet modules in the same way
    as any other module.
  * Supports Excel 97-2003, Excel 2007+, Word 97-2003, Word 2007+,
    PowerPoint 2007+, and Outlook files.
  * Compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## Using
VBA Sync has two modes: **Extract** mode extracts modules
from the file into the folder. You can then commit the extracted files
to version control. **Publish** mode publishes modules from
the folder into the file. You should do this after merges.

After you select a mode, a folder path, and a file path, the tool will
list which modules have changed, with a checkbox next to each. Tick
the checkbox next to each module with changes you'd like to apply.
Double-click an entry to run a diff tool against the old and new files.
(This requires setting up a diff tool under **File**→**Settings**.)
If the underlying files change, click **Refresh**. When you're ready
to synchronize, click **Apply** or **OK**.

You can save and load session settings from the **File** menu. Settings
are saved as `.ini` files. If a settings file is named `VBASync.ini`
and located in the working directory, VBA Sync will load those
settings automatically. I recommend taking advantage of this and
launching VBA Sync from a shortcut with the working directory overridden,
to avoid having to specify the folder and file each time you need to synchronize.

## Command-line
You can also specify settings on the command-line via switches:

Switch | Meaning
------ | ------
`-x`   | Extract VBA from Office file (default)
`-p`   | Publish VBA to Office file
`-f <file>` | Specify Office file
`-d <dir>` | Specify version-control directory
`-r`   | Do the selected action, then immediately exit (**required** on Linux/Mac)
`-i`   | Ignore empty modules
`-u`   | Search subdirectories of version-control directory
`-a`   | Allow adding new document modules when publishing (expert option)
`-e`   | Allow deleting document modules when publishing (expert option)
`-h <hook>` | If `-p` was specified earlier, set the before-publish hook. Else set the after-extract hook.

Any other parameter passed to VBA Sync will be read and parsed as a session `.ini` file.
